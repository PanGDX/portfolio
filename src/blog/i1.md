# Why I Love Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS has taken the frontend world by storm. It provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML.

## The Utility-First Workflow

Instead of writing CSS classes like `.btn-primary`, you write classes like:

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Click Me
</button>
```

### Managing Complexity

One common criticism is that HTML becomes cluttered. However, by extracting components (using React, Vue, etc.) or using the `@apply` directive, you can keep your codebase clean.

## Responsive Design

Tailwind makes responsive design incredibly intuitive using prefixes:

- `md:flex`: Apply flexbox only on medium screens and up.
- `lg:w-1/2`: Width is 50% on large screens.

| Breakpoint | Prefix | Minimum Width |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Small | `sm` | 640px |
| Medium | `md` | 768px |
| Large | `lg` | 1024px |

It's truly a game changer for modern web development.
