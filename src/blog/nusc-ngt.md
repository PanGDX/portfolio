### TLDR;

- Examines the subtle persistence of Orientalism in contemporary American society.
- Argues that acceptance of 'the other' is often conditional and requires adherence to dominant cultural norms.
- The "model minority" myth is a key example of this phenomenon, creating a 'gilded cage'.
- True inclusivity requires a deeper understanding and appreciation of cultural differences, not just superficial acceptance.
