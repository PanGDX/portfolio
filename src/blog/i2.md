# The Future is Here

React Server Components (RSC) represent a paradigm shift in how we build React applications. By allowing components to render exclusively on the server, we can reduce the bundle size sent to the client and improve initial page load performance.

## Why RSC Matters

Traditionally, React has been a client-side library. Even with SSR (Server-Side Rendering), the hydration process required sending the JavaScript for components to the browser.

> "Server Components allow developers to build apps that span the server and client, combining the rich interactivity of client-side apps with the improved performance of traditional server rendering."

### Key Benefits

1. **Zero Bundle Size**: Components that only run on the server don't add to the JavaScript bundle.
2. **Direct Backend Access**: Access your database directly from your component.
3. **Automatic Code Splitting**: Server components can dynamically import client components.

## Code Example

Here is how you might fetch data in a Server Component:

```jsx
// Note: This is an async component
export default async function Note({ id }) {
  const note = await db.notes.get(id);
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{note.title}</h2>
      <section>{note.body}</section>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The future looks bright for React developers!
