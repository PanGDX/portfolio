### TLDR;

- In a team of three, built a robot for remote navigation in unknown, obstacle-filled rooms.
- Implemented a simple Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) and integrated Lidar for environment mapping.
- Developed a CLI to send low-latency commands for remote control.
- The robot successfully generated a 2D map of its surroundings for the remote operator.
