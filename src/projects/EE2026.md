### TLDR;

- Led the integration of a complex calculator project on a Basys 3 FPGA using Verilog.
- Designed a modular, pipelined ALU supporting fixed-point arithmetic (including multiplication, division, and exponentiation).
- Managed timing constraints, BRAM, and input streaming to handle complex calculations.
- Successfully integrated all components: ALU, memory, OLED displays, and input handling with a handshake protocol.
