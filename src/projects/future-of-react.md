# The Future of React Development

React continues to evolve at a rapid pace. With the introduction of **Server Components** and the stabilization of the `use` hook, the way we build web applications is shifting fundamentally.

## Key Changes

1. **Server Actions**: Seamlessly RPC calls.
2. **Concurrent Features**: Smoother UI transitions.
3. **Compiler**: React Compiler (React Forget) is automating memoization.

### What this means for you

Developers need to adapt to a hybrid mental model where components live on the server or the client. It's a challenging but exciting time to be a frontend engineer.

```javascript
function Welcome({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
}
```

The ecosystem is maturing, and performance defaults are getting better.
