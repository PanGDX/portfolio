### TLDR;

- Developed an autonomous maze-solving robot in a team of three.
- Implemented PID control for precise movement and navigation.
- Utilized custom-built IR sensors and an ultrasonic sensor for wall detection and distance measurement.
- A calibrated color sensor detected ground lines to trigger specific maneuvers like turns and rotations.
